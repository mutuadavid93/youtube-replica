### TailwindCSS Breakpoints

min-w-full : An element can take the full available space or go beyond that

w-[100%] : Just In Time (JIT) generates a dynamic width of 100%. The best part is that
it can allow responsive variants e.g.

md:w-[100%] :  which would apply the width of 100% only from the medium breakpoint and above.
